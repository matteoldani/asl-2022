- Different implementations of BLAS - taken into account
- Cost of BLAS functions initially done by going through the Fortran code
- Wondered about the cost of rand(), sqrt... - count them as 1 (happen rarely)
- Wondered if we should count comparison as an op - no (happens rarely)
- Making BLAS single threaded
- OpenBLAS first! - if we have time, we can do a little analysis on different BLAS impls and their performance
