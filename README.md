## How to use

baseline1.c contains the code for the first baseline implementation. This implementation initializes the factorisation matriced with random values between 0 and 1. 

random_matrix_generator.c is used to craft random populated matrices to be factorized. The program will output to stdout the output_dimension followed by the matrix dimension and the matrix itsef. This can be used as input for the baseline binary (./matrix_random_generation | ./baseline1)
